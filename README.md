# Resilience Mapping

Using satellite observations to assess and analyze the impact of land and water regenration effort. Remotely sensend vegetation conditions are analyzed to assess the impact of interventions.    

- Landsat 7 & 8 images are used in this example 
- Python API for GEE for data access 
- Python for analysis and plotting

**Note**: GEE acount and an ee python environment will be needed to use the codes as is (or modify as needed).For more details contact at vikalp.mishra@nasa.gov

Here as an example a json file is provided with polygons (or fields) intervened in 2016 in West Africa and csv file as lookup table for additional details to add into the plot. I made my json files by intervention year and subsequent codes/output files were named accordingly, please change the name, paths, years according to your needs.
